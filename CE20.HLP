\50
   FREQ BAND

   Displays the frequency band of the radio, VHF or UHF.
   Default is VHF.  This will change to the correct band
   automatically when the radio is read (uploaded) into
   the computer.

\51
   1ST IF

   Do not alter this setting after the frequency band
   selection has automatically set the value, unless 
   you have performed special modifications to the 
   radio.

\52
   LOCAL OFFSET

   Do not alter this setting after the frequency band
   selection has automatically set the value unless you
   are performing special modifications to the radio.

   Change this setting to eliminate image problems in
   some service areas.  Radio will have to be retuned
   after modification.  This information is used in
   conjunction with IF, REF OSC FREQ and channel
   information to compute divide-by numbers.

\53
   CHAN SPACING

   Minimum channel step size.  The software will round-
   off incorrect entries to the nearest valid frequency.

   This value does NOT indicate the radio's "wide" (25
   kHz) or "narrow" (12.5 kHz) band hardware status
   (receiver bandwidth filter and TX modulation
   alignment).

\54
   SQUELCH TIMER

   This will specify the amount of time that radio's
   squelch circuit will be needed to react when carrier
   is present.

\55
   PDO CONTROL TIMER

   This will specify the amount of time that is required
   for radio's PDO control.

\56
   MEMORY CHANNELS

   This will specify the number of channels for the radio.

\60
   DEFAULT SPLIT

   This is useful if you are going to program many 
   channels with a fixed repeater offset for the 
   transmit frequency. You should enter the amount
   of shift from the receive frequency that will be 
   applied to the transmit frequency. For example, 
   for most UHF repeaters you will enter 5 MHz. When
   you enter the receive frequency, the transmit
   frequency will be entered with the correct amount
   of offset already applied.  For negative offsets,
   enter the minus sign before the numbers.
   Default is 0.0.

\61
   HOME CHANNEL
   
   For transmissions after scanning stops: select whether
   operation shifts to Piority Ch 1 or to the channel
   selected when scanning started. Talk Back must be
   disabled to allow Home Channel selection.

\62
   OFF HOOK

   Enable/disable squelch override via the microphone
   hanger (when the microphone is removed from the hanger).

\63
   MONITOR
   
   Enable/disable squelch override via the MON button.

\64
   TX TIME OUT
 
   Transmitter Time-Out Timer enabled (to limit length
   of transmissions, 0.5 to 7.5 minutes) or disabled.

\65
   TIME OUT RESUME
   
   Minimum time to wait (0, 6, 20 or 60 sec) after Tx
   Time-Out before transmitter can be reactivated.

\66
   TX CARRIER DELAY
   
   When enable, releasing the PTT switch will leave the
   transmitter active (without modulation) for an extra
   400ms, eliminating the squelch tail at the receiving
   end.

\67

   radio, but the radio will act as if they are not
   present.  A locked channel cannot be edited by the
   software.  Channel 001 can never be locked.

\304
   TRANSMIT FREQUENCY

   Enter the transmit frequency, which should be a 
   multiple of the Spacing shown at the top of the
   screen.  If an incorrect entry is made, the software
   will round off the entry to the nearest valid

   This entry may be programmed to shift automatically
   to any offset of the receive frequency.  The offset
   (Default Split) is programmed in the Common menu.
   When offset is programmed, the software auto-
   matically writes the TX frequency with the desired
   offset immediately after the RX frequency is entered.

   The transmitter can be inhibited on any channel by
   bringing the cursor to this column and pressing the
   SPACE bar.  When TX inhibit is on, the frequency
   numbers are replaced with dashed lines.

\313
   LOCK OUT

   This column will toggle between Busy Channel Lock Out
   (BCLO), Busy Tone Lock Out (BTLO) and none (four 
   dashes appear).  BCLO will inhibit the transmit 
   function if the radio detects a carrier on frequency.  
   BTLO will allow radio to transmit only when the correct 
   tone is decoded. This is useful when the user is 
   operating in a shared repeater system where there may 
   be multiple user groups on the same repeater using 
   different tones.
